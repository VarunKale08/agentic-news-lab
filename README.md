# agentic-news-lab
AgenticNewsLab is a research prototype that decomposes news processing into specialized agents (Fetcher, Cleaner, Summarizer, Sentiment, Coordinator). The system parallelizes LLM workloads, produces cluster-level summaries across sources, and exposes agent-level provenance (who produced each output, confidence, and timing).
